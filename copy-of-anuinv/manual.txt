================================================================================
                            KEY CONCEPTS
================================================================================

RAW MATERIALS vs. PRODUCTS
---------------------------
- Raw Materials: Ingredients and packaging used to make candy (e.g., Sugar, 
  Glucose, Plastic Bags)
- Products: Finished candy items ready for sale (e.g., Hilwit, Daru)

MINIMUM STOCK LEVELS
--------------------
Each item has a minimum stock threshold. When quantity falls at or below this 
level, the item is marked as "Low Stock" and appears in alerts.

PRODUCTION BATCHES
------------------
- Maximum 3 batches can run simultaneously
- Each batch consumes raw materials when started
- Finished products are added to inventory when batch is completed
- Each batch has a unique ID for tracking

COST TRACKING
-------------
- Raw materials have a cost per unit
- Production batches calculate total cost based on ingredients used
- Cost per unit is calculated for each batch
- Costs are tracked in transaction history

TRANSACTIONS
------------
Every action (restock, production start/finish) creates a transaction record 
with timestamp, type, and details. This provides a complete audit trail.

                            TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

ISSUE: Cannot start production
SOLUTION: Check that all required ingredients are available in sufficient 
          quantities. Ensure production slots are not full (max 3).

ISSUE: AI features not working
SOLUTION: Verify GEMINI_API_KEY is set in .env.local file. Check browser 
          console for API errors.

ISSUE: Low stock alerts not showing
SOLUTION: Verify item quantity is at or below minimum stock threshold. Check 
          Dashboard for alerts.

ISSUE: Cannot restock
SOLUTION: Ensure you enter a positive number in the restock modal. Check that 
          the modal is properly displayed.

ISSUE: Production batch not finishing
SOLUTION: Click the "Finish" button on the production slot. Ensure the batch 
          is in PROCESSING status.
